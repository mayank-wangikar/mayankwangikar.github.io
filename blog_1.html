      <h1>Why I shouldn't write a Blog</h1>
	  <p1>Hi everyone, This is my first blog so I think I should introduce myself. I am Mayank Wangikar. I go by he/him pronouns. I like to learn random stuff, at the time of writing, I am a student at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhopal. As of now, I am thinking of pursuing a Math Major. I am originally from Pune, Maharashtra, and lived there for most of my life. I love listening to music and watching movies, especially on the big screen.<br></p1>
	  <p2>I feel I shouldn't write a blog, because I don't think people want to read about what niche things interest me, but I will share things that I find interesting, whether that be projects I am working on, Life Experience and Anecdotes or just Random Trivia. I want to keep a record of the time I am living in currently and don't want it to just pass. I think this is enough for my first blog. Thanks for reading :)
