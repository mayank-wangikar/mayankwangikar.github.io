      <h1>Why I shouldn't write a Blog</h1>
	  <p1>I never wanted to start a blog. I don't see myself as an important person who has anything to share with anyone, but I thought, the alternative is studying biology. So I started a blog, this is where y'all would find material to make me cringe and embarrass me in public. I mean it is mostly going to be rambling about random things, I learned, found out, or happened to me in a given week. I am not a good writer by any stretch so, don't expect me to give any deep insight. Expect more of "Why lift yourself is the best Kanye song", "All major world leaders are incels" or "Government is probably spying on me, but I don't care."<br></p1>
	  <p2>Also, please feel free to laugh at me, or think I am very cringe. Cause I am the last person who should ever start a blog. But, my will to not study and procrastinate is very strong. Procrastination takes me to weird places and this is one of them I think I might share random pieces of maths, which would be cool. But for someone who likes maths, I am not that good at it. I want to keep a record of random things I have. But, instantly regret thinking of them. Also, I am very incoherent when I think, and this blog shows. Whenever I try to share anything, I am shut down by the phrase "Who, asked?". This makes me feel like an idiot and truly question myself, really who asked to listen to me rambling? Instead of me trying to reflect and try to understand that maybe not everyone is interested in the same things I like. I am doing the exact opposite. I am probably going to regret making this blog. But, so be it. I have done worse. I need a record of my random thoughts and I can't remember anything. Yeah, I guess you can expect random thoughts from yours truly whenever I want ig. I don't know when the endsems are then I might write two. This is a way to justify not to study.Feel free me to bully with my blog and random things I write here. Thanks for reading fr.
